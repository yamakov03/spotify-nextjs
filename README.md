I created a refreshed, customizable Spotify web client/clone that lets users switch up the standard UI theme to match their mood. It's not an exact copy of the original client, but I wanted to see how close I could get! I've also been wanting light mode for a while, so I decided to get it done.

### Highlights:
- Light mode!!
- Dynamic and rich customization options
- Unified theming across views
- Single-Page Application
- Music player with shuffle
- Infinite Scroll
- Lazy Loading
- Add to liked songs
- Responsive Design

### Tech
- Next.js 13
- React
- Recoil
- Tailwind CSS
- Spotify API/SDK
- Tokenization and auto access/refresh
- oauth
- JWT
- Nextauth
