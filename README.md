I created a refreshed, customizable Spotify web client/clone that lets users switch up the standard UI theme to match their mood. It's not an exact copy of the original client, but I wanted to see how close I could get! I've also been wanting light mode for a while, so I decided to get it done.

**Note:** It seems now that since the app is in development mode, querying user libraries won't work if the user isn't added to the app's allowlist. If you want to try it out with your account, reach out to me at danielyamakov @ utexas dot edu and I can add you!

- Light mode!!
- Dynamic and rich customization options
- Unified theming across views
